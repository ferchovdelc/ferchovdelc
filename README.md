## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on as Professor of International Relations at Universidade Positivo (Curitiba-Brazil)
Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Sciencie at Universidade Positivo. I'm very curious about the development code and operating systems (Linux and Android). Furthermore, I would like to expand my knowledge in these areas of study. Furthermore, I would like as much of my work as possible to be open source.
